/*
 * Alright, get ready for a data dump, because this is where it gets real.
 * Here I attempt to untangle the code spaghetti from the original Fortran
 * implementation, which is exemplified by the NCP and LIVE arrays.
 *
 * Okay, NCP first. Each element L in NCP has a dual interpretation:
 *
 * - In the optimal-transfer stage, NCP(L) stores the step at which cluster L
 *   was last updated. Each step is just the observation index as the optimal
 *   transfer only does one pass through the dataset.
 * - In the quick-transfer stage, NCP(L) stores the step at which cluster L is
 *   last updated plus M (i.e., the number of observations). Here, the step
 *   corresponding to an observation will be 'M * X + obs' for some integer X
 *   >= 0, where X is the iteration of the quick transfer. This means that the
 *   stored value is defined as '(M + 1) * X + obs'.
 * - After each quick_transfer call, NCP(L) is set back to zero so any existing
 *   values will not carry over into the next optimal_transfer call.
 *
 * Note that these two definitions bleed into each other as the NCP(L) set by
 * optimal_transfer is still referenced in the first few iterations of
 * quick_transfer before it eventually gets overwritten. The easiest way to
 * interpret this is to consider the optimal transfer as iteration 'M = -1'
 * from the perspective of the quick transfer iterations. 
 *
 * In short, the NCP array is used to determine whether a cluster was modified
 * within the last M steps of the optimal_transfer or quick_transfer.
 *
 * Let's move onto LIVE, which has an even more painful interpretation:
 *
 * - Before each optimal_transfer call, LIVE(L) stores the observation at which
 *   cluster L was updated in the _previous_ optimal_transfer call.
 * - During the optimal_transfer call, LIVE(L) is updated to the observation at
 *   which L was updated in this call, plus M (i.e., number of observations).
 * - After the optimal_transfer call, LIVE(L) is updated by subtracting M, so
 *   that the interpretation is correct in the next call.
 * - After the quick_transfer call, LIVE(L) is set to M + 1 if a quick transfer
 *   took place for L, effectively mimicking a "very recent" update.
 *
 * It basically tells us whether there was a recent transfer (optimal or quick)
 * within the last M steps of optimal_transfer. If so, the cluster is "live".
 * This differs very slightly from NCP as LIVE only counts optimal transfer
 * steps while NCP counts both optimal and quick transfer steps.
 *
 * We simplify this mess by consolidating NCP and LIVE into a single update
 * history that can serve both purposes. This is possible as LIVE is not used
 * in quick_transfer, while any modifications made to NCP by quick_transfer are
 * ignored and overwritten in optimal_transfer. Thus, there won't be any
 * conflicts between the two meanings in a consolidated update history.
 *
 * The update history for cluster L now holds the iteration ('X') and the
 * observation ('obs') at which the cluster was last modified. This has
 * an obvious mapping to NCP(L), which was already defined in terms of 
 * 'X' and 'obs' anyway. For LIVE(L), the mapping is more complex:
 *
 * - If an optimal_transfer occurred but no quick_transfer occurs for L,
 *   we set 'X = -2'. 'obs' is not modified as it is the observation at
 *   which L was modified in the previous optimal_transfer iteration;
 *   this is basically just the definition of LIVE(L).
 * - If a quick transfer does occur, we set 'X = -2' and 'obs = M + 1'.
 *   Again, this is equivalent to the behavior of LIVE(L).
 * - If neither a quick_transfer nor optimal_transfer occurs for L,
 *   we set 'X = -3' to indicate that L didn't change in any manner.
 * - During the optimal_transfer, we consider a cluster to be live at a
 *   particular observation if it is greater than 'obs'.
 *
 * Note that Fortran is 1-based so the actual code is a little different than
 * described above for 'obs' - specifically, we just need to set it to 'M'
 * when a quick transfer occurs. Meaning of 'X' is unchanged.
 *
 * Incidentally, we can easily detect if a quick transfer occurs based on
 * whether 'X > -1'. This obviates the need for the ITRAN array.

 * @brief Implements the Hartigan-Wong algorithm for k-means clustering.
 *
 * The Hartigan-Wong algorithm performs several iterations of transferring points between clusters, 
 * involving a computationally expensive "optimal transfer" step that checks each observation against each cluster to determine its best assignment,
 * followed by a cheaper "quick transfer" step, which iterates between the best and second-best cluster choices for each observation.
 * The latter enables rapid exploration of the local solution space without the unnecessary expense of repeatedly comparing each observation to all clusters.
 * The choice of "best" cluster for each observation considers the gain/loss in the sum of squares when an observation moves between clusters,
 * even accounting for the shift in the cluster centers after the transfer.
 * The algorithm terminates when no observation wishes to transfer between clusters.
 *
 * This implementation is derived from the Fortran code underlying the `kmeans` function in the **stats** R package,
 * which in turn is derived from Hartigan and Wong (1979).
 * 
 * In the `Details::status` returned by `run()`, the status code is either 0 (success),
 * 2 (maximum optimal transfer iterations reached without convergence)
 * or 4 (maximum quick transfer iterations reached without convergence, if `RefineHartiganWongOptions::quit_on_quick_transfer_convergence_failure = true`).
 * Previous versions of the library would report a status code of 1 upon encountering an empty cluster, but these are now just ignored.
 * 
 * @tparam Matrix_ Matrix type for the input data.
 * This should satisfy the `MockMatrix` contract.
 * @tparam Cluster_ Integer type for the cluster assignments.
 * @tparam Float_ Floating-point type for the centroids.
